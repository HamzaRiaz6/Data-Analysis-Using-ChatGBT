Case Study (AirBnB)
Scenario:
You are a team of data analysts working for a tourism consulting firm. Your task is to
analyze the Airbnb market in a specific city. The datasets provided include information
about Airbnb listings, such as room types, pricing, reviews, and locations. The goal is to
understand the current market, identify trends, and provide recommendations to small
Airbnb hosts looking to optimize their listings.
Tasks:
Data Understanding and Cleaning:
● Identify and handle missing values.
● Deal with any inconsistencies or anomalies in the data (e.g., formatting
issues in the 'price' column).
● Merge datasets appropriately to create a comprehensive view of the data.
Data Analysis and Insights:
● Analyze the distribution of room types and their popularity (based on the
number of reviews).
● Investigate pricing strategies across different neighborhoods and room
types.
● Understand the relationship between price, number of reviews, and the last
review date.
Recommendations:
● Based on the analysis, provide insights on optimal pricing strategies for
different room types and locations.
● Suggest the best practices for hosts to increase the attractiveness of their
listings (e.g., frequency of updates, responsiveness to reviews).
Visualization:
● Create visual representations of key findings (e.g., distribution of room
types, price trends across neighborhoods).
● Use charts to highlight relationships between variables.

Sample Questions to Investigate ( You can obviously look at other questions and
trends as you see fit)
1. How does the distribution of room types vary across different neighborhoods?

2. What is the relationship between the price of a listing and its popularity (number
of reviews)?
3. Does the recency of reviews (last review date) impact the perceived quality or
popularity of a listing?
4. Can we identify any trends or patterns in pricing across different neighborhoods
or room types?
5. What recommendations would you make to a new Airbnb host based on your
analysis?
